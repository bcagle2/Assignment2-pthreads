To compile:
	g++ a3-12.cpp -o a3-12.exe -O3 -pthread

To run question 3 (mutex run):
	use the script file runmutex.sh

To run question 4 (granularity run):
	use the script file runq4all.sh

Note: After question 3 was complete, the program was updated to write the output files to output12q4.txt and output12q4.csv.  The program writes to these files for both question 3 and question 4.  So, if you want both sets, you have to rename the files between runs.

Description of other files: output12.txt and output12.csv have the output from question 3.  output12q4.txt and output12q4.csv have the output from question 4.



Charts/Plots for questions 3 and 4 are in the ChartsPlots folder and are named as follows:
 output12q3.xlsx	This is the chart for question 3 (mutex)

Charts below are for question 4 (granularity).  The name of the file indicated the intensity and the number of points.
