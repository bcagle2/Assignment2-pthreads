To compile:
	g++ main.cpp -o a3-11.exe -O3

To run use the script file runa3-11.sh

Note that to output files are produced.  output.txt has somewhat readable results and output.csv has the results in a spreadsheet format.

The script file is supposed to delete these output files before writing them again, but sometimes it doesn't work on Mamba.  



The charts are in the ChartsPlots folder.
