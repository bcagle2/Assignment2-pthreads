Observations for question 4:
 How does the speedup change with 16 computational threads?

 The chart shows a trend of a direct relationship between intensity and speedup.  That is to say, as the operational intensity increases, so does the speedup observed.



Observations for question 5:
 Vary the ration of intensity.  How does the speedup change with 16 computational threads?

 The observed data, as reflected in the chart, shows that speedup is decreasing as the intensity factor is increased.
